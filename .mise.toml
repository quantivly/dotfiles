# Dotfiles mise Configuration
# ============================
# ✨ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for CLI tool versions
#
# Configuration Flow:
#   1. This file (.dotfiles/.mise.toml) - Defines all CLI tool versions
#   2. Symlinked to: ~/.config/mise/config.toml (during dotfiles ./install)
#   3. Used by: mise to install and manage CLI tools
#
# Note: dev-setup only installs the mise binary, not the tools
# All CLI tools (bat, fd, eza, etc.) are managed here in dotfiles
#
# Personal Customization:
#   ✓ Enable optional tools (uncomment lines below)
#   ✓ Override versions for testing
#   ✓ Add personal tools without affecting team
#
# For Personal Tool Overrides:
#   Create: ~/.config/mise/config.local.toml
#   Add your custom tools there (not tracked in dotfiles)
#   Example:
#     [tools]
#     hyperfine = "1.18.0"  # Personal benchmarking tool
#     dive = "0.12.0"        # Docker image analyzer
#
# To upgrade tools:
#   1. Check for updates: mise outdated
#   2. Test locally: mise use <tool>@<new-version>
#   3. Update this file with new version
#   4. Pull changes: cd ~/.dotfiles && git pull && ./install
#   5. Commit with Linear issue reference
#
# See: docs/TOOL_VERSION_UPDATES.md for detailed procedures
