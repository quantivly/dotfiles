# GPG Signing (Recommended)
# Signing your commits helps verify your identity and is strongly encouraged.
#
# Setup steps:
# 1. Generate a GPG key: gpg --full-generate-key
# 2. Get your key ID: gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
# 3. Add your key ID below (the part after "rsa4096/" or "ed25519/")
# 4. Add your GPG public key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
# 5. Uncomment the lines below:
#
# [user]
# 	signingkey = YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
#
# [commit]
# 	gpgsign = true
#
# [gpg]
# 	program = gpg
#
# Need help with GPG setup? See:
#   - Quick start: ~/.dotfiles/examples/gpg-setup-guide.md
#   - Reference:   ~/.dotfiles/docs/GPG_SIGNING_SETUP.md
#
# Quick test after setup:
#   gpg-prime                           # Prime cache (enter passphrase)
#   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test"  # Test signing
#   git log --show-signature -1         # Verify signature
#
# Daily usage:
#   gpg-prime   # Run once when you start working
#   # ... work normally, commits signed automatically ...

# Machine-specific git configuration
# Add any other personal git settings here
