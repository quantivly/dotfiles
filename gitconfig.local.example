# Personal Git Configuration
# This file is sourced by ~/.gitconfig and should contain your personal settings.
# Copy this to ~/.gitconfig.local and customize it.
#
# DO NOT commit ~/.gitconfig.local to git - it contains personal information!

[user]
	name = Your Name
	email = your.email@quantivly.com

# Commit Signing with SSH (Recommended)
# Signing your commits helps verify your identity and is strongly encouraged.
# SSH signing (Git 2.34+) is simpler than GPG and integrates with SSH agent workflows.
#
# Setup steps (5 minutes):
# 1. Get your SSH public key:
#    - File-based: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#    - Bitwarden: ssh-add -L
#
# 2. Create allowed signers file:
#    mkdir -p ~/.ssh
#    echo "your.email@quantivly.com $(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" > ~/.ssh/allowedSigners
#
# 3. Add your SSH public key to GitHub as a "Signing Key":
#    https://github.com/settings/keys (select "Signing Key" type)
#
# 4. Uncomment and configure the lines below:
#
# [user]
# 	signingkey = ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza... your.email@quantivly.com
#
# [commit]
# 	gpgsign = true
#
# [gpg]
# 	format = ssh
#
# [gpg "ssh"]
# 	allowedSignersFile = ~/.ssh/allowedSigners
#
# Need help? See: ~/.dotfiles/docs/SSH_SIGNING_SETUP.md
#
# Quick test after setup:
#   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test SSH signing"
#   git log --show-signature -1  # Should show "Good 'git' signature with ED25519 key..."
#
# Daily usage:
#   Just commit normally - signing is automatic via ssh-agent!
#   (No cache priming needed unlike GPG)

# Safe Directory Configuration (Recommended)
# Prevents Git from polluting your tracked gitconfig with safe.directory entries.
# This is particularly important when running tests or working in temporary directories.
#
# Check your Git version: git --version
# Git 2.35.2+ supports wildcard patterns. Recommended approach:
[safe]
    directory = ~/*
    directory = /tmp/*
#
# Or be more specific for Quantivly development (more secure):
# [safe]
#     directory = ~/platform/*      # Q_DEV_CODE_ROOT
#     directory = ~/hub/*            # Q_HUB_ROOT
#     directory = ~/workspaces/*     # Workspaces
#     directory = ~/quanticli        # Quanticli repo
#     directory = ~/quantivly/*      # Quantivly repos
#     directory = ~/.dotfiles        # Personal dotfiles
#     directory = /tmp/*             # Test directories
#
# Alternative (most permissive - trusts all directories):
# [safe]
#     directory = *
#
# For older Git versions (no wildcards - list each directory individually):
# [safe]
#     directory = ~/.dotfiles
#     directory = ~/platform/auto-conf
#     directory = ~/platform/sre-core
#     directory = ~/hub/sre-customers-library
#     directory = ~/workspaces/dev
#     directory = ~/quanticli

# Machine-specific git configuration
# Add any other personal git settings here
