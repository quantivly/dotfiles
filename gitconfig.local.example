# Personal Git Configuration
# This file is sourced by ~/.gitconfig and should contain your personal settings.
# Copy this to ~/.gitconfig.local and customize it.
#
# DO NOT commit ~/.gitconfig.local to git - it contains personal information!

# GPG Signing (Recommended)
# Signing your commits helps verify your identity and is strongly encouraged.
#
# Setup steps:
# 1. Generate a GPG key: gpg --full-generate-key
# 2. Get your key ID: gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
# 3. Add your key ID below (the part after "rsa4096/" or "ed25519/")
# 4. Add your GPG public key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
# 5. Uncomment the lines below:
#
# [user]
# 	signingkey = YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
#
# [commit]
# 	gpgsign = true
#
# [gpg]
# 	program = gpg
#
# Need help with GPG setup? See:
#   - Quick start: ~/.dotfiles/examples/gpg-setup-guide.md
#   - Reference:   ~/.dotfiles/docs/GPG_SIGNING_SETUP.md
#
# Quick test after setup:
#   gpg-prime                           # Prime cache (enter passphrase)
#   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test"  # Test signing
#   git log --show-signature -1         # Verify signature
#
# Daily usage:
#   gpg-prime   # Run once when you start working
#   # ... work normally, commits signed automatically ...

# Safe Directory Configuration (Recommended)
# Prevents Git from polluting your tracked gitconfig with safe.directory entries.
# This is particularly important when running tests or working in temporary directories.
#
# Check your Git version: git --version
# Git 2.35.2+ supports wildcard patterns. Recommended approach:
[safe]
    directory = ~/*
    directory = /tmp/*
#
# Or be more specific for Quantivly development (more secure):
# [safe]
#     directory = ~/platform/*      # Q_DEV_CODE_ROOT
#     directory = ~/hub/*            # Q_HUB_ROOT
#     directory = ~/workspaces/*     # Workspaces
#     directory = ~/quanticli        # Quanticli repo
#     directory = ~/quantivly/*      # Quantivly repos
#     directory = ~/.dotfiles        # Personal dotfiles
#     directory = /tmp/*             # Test directories
#
# Alternative (most permissive - trusts all directories):
# [safe]
#     directory = *
#
# For older Git versions (no wildcards - list each directory individually):
# [safe]
#     directory = ~/.dotfiles
#     directory = ~/platform/auto-conf
#     directory = ~/platform/sre-core
#     directory = ~/hub/sre-customers-library
#     directory = ~/workspaces/dev
#     directory = ~/quanticli

# Machine-specific git configuration
# Add any other personal git settings here
