# Poetry Configuration
# Enables project-local virtualenvs for isolation and reliability
#
# This configuration follows industry best practices (2024-2026) and prevents
# cross-project virtualenv contamination by creating .venv/ directories in
# each project root instead of using a shared cache.
#
# Benefits:
# - Better IDE auto-detection (.venv is standard convention)
# - Easier CI/CD caching (venv included in project)
# - Eliminates cross-project interference
# - Predictable virtualenv locations
