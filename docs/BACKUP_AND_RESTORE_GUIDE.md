# Backup & Restore Guide

Reproducible, encrypted **3-2-1 backups** for this workstation using **restic** (the
engine) orchestrated by **resticprofile** (declarative scheduling, retention, checks).
Backs up to an **external HDD** (when docked) and **Backblaze B2** (offsite), with an
**offline emergency kit** so a future brick is a quick, complete recovery — not a
from-memory rebuild.

This is the data-and-recovery layer. The *toolchain* is already reproduced by
`quantivly/dev-setup` + this dotfiles repo; backups cover what those don't: credentials,
unpushed work, app/desktop state, network/VPN secrets, and personal files.

## Quick start

```bash
backup-init                 # create ~/.backup.local from the template
${EDITOR:-vim} ~/.backup.local   # fill in repo paths, B2 keys, healthcheck URLs
backup-setup                # one-time guided install (restic, repos, timers, kit)

backup-now                  # run a backup now (both targets; b2 first)
backup-status               # targets reachable? timers armed? latest snapshot?
backup-restore              # guided restore of a snapshot to ~/restore-<ts>/
```

## Architecture — three layers

| Layer | Tool | Protects against |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **1. Data (spine)** | restic + resticprofile → external HDD + Backblaze B2 | Disk failure, theft, fire, ransomware, accidental deletion |
| **2. Root-of-trust** | Bitwarden (online) + an age-encrypted **offline emergency kit** | The cold-start lockout (see below) |
| **3. System rollback** | Timeshift (rsync) + LUKS header backup | A bad apt upgrade / broken `/etc`; a corrupt LUKS header |

**3-2-1:** 3 copies (laptop SSD + external HDD + B2), on 2 media, with 1 offsite (B2).

**Why restic + resticprofile:** restic is the most established encrypted/deduplicated
engine that speaks both local disk and B2 natively. resticprofile is the declarative
orchestrator — a versioned [`resticprofile/profiles.toml`](../resticprofile/profiles.toml)
defines the policy (sources, excludes, retention, checks, schedule) and *generates* the
systemd timers, so there is almost no bespoke shell to maintain.

**The cold-start paradox (why the emergency kit is mandatory):** to restore from restic
you need the repo password + B2 keys → those live in Bitwarden → Bitwarden needs its
master password + 2FA + a network → your WiFi/VPN secrets are *inside the backup you
can't open yet* → cloning the private `dev-setup` repo needs SSH → SSH keys are in
Bitwarden. The offline kit lives entirely outside this loop and breaks it.

## What is backed up vs. regenerated

The backup runs **as root** (so it can read `/etc` and the GNOME keyring). Sources and
excludes live in [`examples/backup-includes.txt`](../examples/backup-includes.txt) and
[`examples/backup-excludes.txt`](../examples/backup-excludes.txt) (installed to `/etc/restic/`).

| Backed up | Excluded (regenerable) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| All of `/home/zvi` (incl. `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config`, keyring, `~/.dotfiles`) | `~/.cache`, `~/.npm`, `~/.local/share/mise`, `~/.oh-my-zsh` |
| `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` (WiFi/VPN secrets) | `**/node_modules`, `**/.venv`, `**/__pycache__`, build dirs |
| `/etc` slice: `hosts`, `sysctl.d`, `apt` repos+keyrings, custom systemd units | browser `Cache`/`Code Cache`/`GPUCache` (profiles kept) |
| `/opt/awsvpnclient` (AWS VPN Client) | `~/.vscode/extensions` (list captured in the manifest) |
| A **system manifest** (`/var/backups/system-manifest.txt`) | `/swap.img`, `/tmp`, pseudo-filesystems |

> **Regenerate, do NOT restore** onto a fresh install: `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/crypttab`
> (new LUKS/LVM UUIDs), `/etc/machine-id`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*`. They are captured for
> *reference* only — restoring them yields an unbootable system.

The **system manifest** (refreshed before each snapshot by
[`scripts/backup-manifest.sh`](../scripts/backup-manifest.sh)) records `apt-mark
showmanual`, third-party apt repos, `snap list` + connections, VS Code/GNOME extensions,
`mise ls`, and disk UUIDs — turning post-brick reconfiguration into a diffable checklist.

## One-time setup

**Prerequisites**

1. **Bitwarden** — your existing vault is the root-of-trust (it already serves your SSH
   keys). You'll store the restic repo key there.
2. **Backblaze B2** — create an account and a private bucket (e.g. `cilantro-backup`).
   Note the bucket's **S3 endpoint** (e.g. `s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com`).
3. **External HDD** — any **ext4** drive. Set `BACKUP_EXTERNAL_REPO` to
   `<mountpoint>/restic`; restic stores its repo in that subfolder *alongside* your
   existing files (non-destructive). Modern udisks mounts removable drives at
   `/run/media/<user>/<label>` (older setups: `/media/<user>/<label>`) — confirm with
   `findmnt /dev/sdXN` and match the config to it. No need to LUKS-encrypt the drive:
   restic encrypts the repo and the emergency kit is age-encrypted.

**Two B2 application keys** (ransomware resistance):

| Key | Capabilities | Lives where | Used by |
|-----|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Append-only** | `listBuckets,listFiles,readFiles,writeFiles` (NO `deleteFiles`) | `~/.backup.local` (on-disk) | the daily timer |
| **Full access** | read + delete | **emergency kit only** (offline) | restore & `backup-prune` |

Add a **lifecycle rule** to the bucket (reaps versions restic "hides", giving a 30-day
tamper window):

```bash
b2 bucket update <bucket> allPrivate \
  --lifecycleRule '{"daysFromHidingToDeleting":30,"daysFromUploadingToHiding":null,"fileNamePrefix":""}'
```

> Do **not** enable B2 Object Lock — it conflicts with restic's deduplication and breaks
> `prune`. The append-only key + lifecycle rule is the supported pattern.

**Run it**

```bash
backup-init                       # ~/.backup.local from template
${EDITOR:-vim} ~/.backup.local    # repo paths, the APPEND-ONLY B2 key, healthcheck URLs
backup-setup                      # installs restic+resticprofile, inits repos, timers,
                                  # Timeshift, LUKS header backup, emergency kit
```

`backup-setup` is idempotent — re-run it any time you edit `~/.backup.local`.

## Daily operation

It's automatic. The timers and the dock trigger run backups for you; the commands below
are for on-demand use and inspection.

| Command | Does |
|---------|------|
| `backup-now [b2\|external\|cilantro]` | Back up now (default both; b2 first) |
| `backup-status` | Targets reachable? timers armed? latest snapshot? |
| `backup-snapshots [b2\|external]` | List snapshots |
| `backup-check [b2\|external]` | Verify repository integrity |
| `backup-restore [b2\|external]` | Guided restore to `~/restore-<ts>/` |
| `backup-mount [b2\|external]` | Browse a repo via FUSE (`~/backup-mnt`) |
| `backup-prune` | Prune B2 with the offline full key |
| `backup-luks-header` | Re-take the LUKS header backup |
| `backup-kit` | Emergency-kit status + reminder |

**Automation**

- **Cloud (B2):** a daily systemd timer (generated by resticprofile, `Persistent=true`
  so it catches up missed runs after sleep/boot), plus a weekly integrity check.
- **External HDD:** a 6-hourly timer ([`systemd/restic-backup-external.timer`](../systemd/restic-backup-external.timer))
  drives a `ConditionPathExists`-gated service, so it backs up **only when the drive is
  docked** and is a clean no-op otherwise. For an immediate backup after docking, run
  `backup-now external`. (A `.path` "exists" trigger is deliberately avoided — `PathExists`
  retriggers a oneshot service in a tight loop while the file exists.)
- **Monitoring:** set `BACKUP_HC_URL_*` to [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io)
  check URLs. The run-after hook pings on success and `/fail` on failure, so you're
  **alerted when a backup is overdue** (asleep / undocked / offline). This is the
  difference between "I have backups" and "I had backups until five weeks ago."
- **Desktop notifications** via `notify-send` (bridged from the root run into your GUI
  session by [`scripts/restic-notify.sh`](../scripts/restic-notify.sh)). **Failures always
  notify; successes are silent** unless you set `BACKUP_NOTIFY_SUCCESS=1` — the healthcheck
  ping is the success signal.

## Emergency kit (offline)

A single **age identity** is the only thing kept truly offline — printed on paper (or as
a QR) **and** on an offline USB. Everything else goes into one `emergency-kit.age` blob
(stored on the USB, inside the restic repo, and on the external HDD). To recover you need
only the age key → decrypt → get everything. `backup-setup` scaffolds this; `backup-kit`
shows its status. Contents:

- restic repo password; **B2 full-access key**; B2 account login + 2FA recovery codes
- Bitwarden master password + 2FA recovery code + a periodic encrypted vault export
- LUKS passphrase(s) + the header-backup file (`/root/luks-header-<host>.img`)
- home/office WiFi PSK; a GitHub **PAT** (HTTPS fallback to clone the private repos)
- this runbook; optionally tarballs of `dev-setup` + `dotfiles` and a static `restic` binary

## Disaster recovery runbook

Keep a tested **Ubuntu install USB** with the kit. Then:

1. **Reinstall** Ubuntu with LUKS (note the new passphrase).
2. **Network:** restore the WiFi PSK from the kit, or tether via phone/USB.
3. **Unlock secrets:** recover the **age key** from the kit → decrypt `emergency-kit.age`.
   Open Bitwarden (web/CLI via the encrypted export — don't wait on rebuilding the snap).
4. **Bootstrap:** clone `dev-setup` + `dotfiles` over **HTTPS + PAT** (SSH/Bitwarden-agent
   isn't up yet). Run `dev-setup`, then dotfiles `./install`.
5. **Restore data:** install restic, then restore the latest snapshot with the **full
   key** → `/home` + the `/etc` slice. **Skip** `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/crypttab`,
   `/etc/machine-id`, `ssh_host_*` (let the install's own versions stand).
6. **Re-auth from Bitwarden:** SSH agent, `gh auth login`, app logins. The restored GNOME
   keyring / Chrome passwords are **not** relied upon to unlock (Bitwarden is the source
   of truth). Reinstall the **AWS VPN Client** and restore `~/.config/AWSVPNClient`.
7. **Re-arm:** run `backup-setup` to reinstall the timers and re-take the LUKS header.

## Verification & drills

Backups you've never restored aren't backups. Maintain this regimen:

- **Quarterly restore drill** — run the whole runbook from the kit into a VM or spare
  disk. The real test is the *bootstrap* (network → vault → HTTPS clone), not just `restic restore`.
- **Weekly** `restic check`; **monthly** `restic check --read-data-subset=10%` (rotating —
  full coverage over ~10 weeks). Scheduled automatically for B2; on demand via `backup-check`.
- **Ransomware proof:** with the stored append-only key, `restic forget` must **fail**
  (deletion blocked); the kit's full key must succeed.
- **LUKS:** verify the header backup restores to a loop file
  (`cryptsetup luksHeaderRestore`); re-take it (`backup-luks-header`) after any passphrase change.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `backup-status` shows no timers | Run `backup-setup`; check `resticprofile -c /etc/resticprofile/profiles.toml schedule --all`. |
| External backup doesn't run when docked | Check `systemctl status restic-backup-external.timer` and `journalctl -u restic-backup-external.service`. The service skips (condition not met) unless `<BACKUP_EXTERNAL_REPO>/config` exists — confirm the drive is mounted where `~/.backup.local` expects (modern udisks uses `/run/media/<user>/<label>`). Force one now: `backup-now external`. |
| B2 backup fails (`AccessDenied`) | The append-only key can't prune — ensure no `[b2.retention]` is set; for pruning use `backup-prune` with the full key. |
| `restic init` fails on external | Dock the drive first; re-run `backup-setup` (it inits then, or it inits on the first dock backup). |
| Config parse error | `resticprofile -c /etc/resticprofile/profiles.toml show` to validate after edits. |
| No desktop notification | Expected when logged out; check the healthchecks ping and `journalctl` instead. |
| Restored files are root-owned | Restores run as root; `backup-restore` chowns `~/restore-*` back to you automatically. |
